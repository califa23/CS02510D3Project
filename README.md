# Visual Analytics D3 Project

## Setup
- First, clone this project
- This project needs to be hosted in order to access multiple files in its directory to make working in it much easier.
- I suggest running a local server with the help of Node.js
- Install Node.js here: https://nodejs.org/en/download/
- Once installed, run `npm install -g http-server` in a terminal
- Then, in the terminal, navigate to this project directory where it was cloned and run `http-server`
- You should now be able to access the local server on a web browser at http://127.0.0.1:8080
    - I suggest chrome like Sun said.

## Contributing
- Please create your own branch on this project and do not merge before testing and letting us all know
    - ex: `git checkout -B /califano`
